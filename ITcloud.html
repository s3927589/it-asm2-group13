				<div class="blog-subtitle">What does it do?</div>
				<p>Cloud computing refers to the use of computing resources that are delivered as a service via the Internet in order to provide a secure, and on demand network access to a pool of configurable resources and various services, such as: Software as a Service (SAAS) and Platform as a Service (PAAS) (XX).</p>

                   <p> Cloud computing depends on web computing where virtual shared servers give software infrastructure platform devices and other resources and hosting to clients in view of on a compensation as you utilize the services. Cloud computing provides its client with numerous capabilities like getting to an extensive number of uses without the requirement for having a permit, buying, introducing or downloading any of these applications. It likewise diminishes both running and installation costs of computers and software as there is no need to have any infrastructure (Narshimhar et. al. 2017 X). Clients can access data anyplace; all they require is to interface with a system (usually the Internet). Without Internet access, users can't run web-based applications or open documents stored on the web. Cloud computing clients don't claim the physical framework rather they rent the usage from a third-party provider. They consume resources as a service and only pay for resources that they consume (Rehman 2018). </p>

                   <p> According to the Markets and Markets report (2021), the market capitalization for cloud technologies valued at $445.3 billion in 2019, and by 2026, cloud computing can soar to $947.3 billion. From their market capitalization, we can tell that cloud computing will become essential for companies to operate successfully in the modern age.  Therefore, each organization needs to begin looking out where precisely Cloud Computing (CC) is required in their business with the goal that they gain a competitive advantage by staying and remaining competitive in their business sector. </p>

                   <p> Besides, numerous technologies contribute to the cloud computing network's reliability, adaptability, and usability, including Virtualization, Grid computing, Utility Computing, and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) (Malik et. al. 2018). </p>

                    <p>
		    Virtualization is defined as the process of creating a virtual computer system comprised of storage devices, servers, desktop computers, operating systems, and network resources. Virtualization permits the simultaneous execution of many operating systems and applications on a single server, thus reducing expenses and enhancing the productivity of an organization's existing infrastructure.

                    Grid Computing is the technique of collaborating on activities by utilizing numerous computers, often geographically dispersed yet connected via networks. Grid computing is popular in e-science, a subfield of study that frequently necessitates massive computing power and communication across disparate data and computing services (Malik et. al. 2018).

                    Utility computing is a concept for computer service delivery that is based on pay-per-use. Rather than charging a set amount, the service provider charges according to the services rendered.

                    Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural concept that enables programs to take advantage of network services.

				<div class="blog-subtitle">What is the likely impact?</div>
				<p>Cloud technology's greatest influence seems to be in the cost reductions and greater competitiveness of IT services offered to public and private enterprises, as well as additional benefits to end users. Cloud computing is a completely new paradigm for personal and business computing that departs from the traditional software business model by relocating data to the cloud rather than purchasing additional hard disks or requiring more processing power for the machine to operate.Organizations no longer have to worry about hardware or software obsolescence or spend large amounts of money on new technology for expansion (Cunningham & Wilkins, 2009, p. 3). With fewer apps concurrently accessing the computer's RAM, the performance of the computer will be better. Desktop computers that utilize cloud-based services may boot and operate more efficiently due to the reduced number of apps and processes loaded into memory.</p>

                   <p> Yet, reliance on cloud services may result in the elimination of some jobs while creating others (Rameshbabu 2021). While cloud computing allows for remote management of networks, cloud services will generate various new jobs as data regulation, transmission, and preservation always require IT workers. Cloud technology is predicted to have the greatest impact on IT occupations during the next 5 - 10 years (Collabera n.d.). Even with the adoption of cloud technology, IT departments will remain functional and a vital component of enterprises. They will, however, need to acquire new cloud computing skills in order to remain a component of the IT industry. Given growing demands, some IT positions tied to in-house demands may be eliminated, whilst cloud computing job roles assisting with remote maintenance of cloud networks are likely to grow.</p><br/>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">How will this affect you?</div>
				<p>Prior to knowing about cloud computing, I frequently struggled with group assignments that required continual communication between members, specifically monitoring work progress and resolving problems. We frequently have to complete it on each computer's Word Document and then forward the work to a member for summary and editing. This is time-consuming and labor-intensive because if we need to edit all of the members' parts, we must send it to each member individually and then repeat the loop. Google Docs was an indispensable tool in college for completing all of my deadlines. I frequently use it to create folders, documents, and spreadsheets and then share them with team members, which is really convenient and improves communication with team members who are geographically distant in real time. Furthermore, we are not required to submit assignments accompanied with a stack of paper. Likewise, teachers are relieved of the burden of printing a bulky book of handout materials for students, as well as the worry of being confused or losing paper when marking. As a result, the carbon footprint and paper expenses are lowered, resulting in a more environmentally friendly atmosphere and decreased environmental damage.
