				<div class="blog-subtitle">What does it do?</div>
				<p>Self-driving cars are gradually becoming a reality, that's for sure. However, the future of this type of car is not as clear and easy as saying "soon I will switch to self-driving cars". Let's see if GM's experimental Super Cruise technology answers lingering questions like how well cars operate, how well robots can drive, and whether humans should be allowed to let cars drive autonomously on the road in the future or not? As soon as the control button entered the black lane, the car's steering wheel seemed to stiffen. Suddenly, the light on the steering wheel turns green, indicating that the car is self-driving. Jeremy Salinger, who works for GM's semi-autonomous vehicle program, has worked with the vehicle dozens, "The car is in self-driving mode." That means the driver has just delegated acceleration and parking to the tuned Cadillac SUV's adaptive cruise control. The vehicle has a built-in computer in the tail that collects data from cameras and sensors to read electronic signals on the road and determine the vehicle's position. By this information, the car controls the electronic steering system to keep itself in the correct lane. Witnessing the test car screeching forward at nearly 100km/h, easily snapping the steering wheel to turn the car into an oval, and then periodically turning and heading straight ahead at GM's Milford Laboratory in Michigan was thrilling. He felt both nervous and anxious, like a ghost driving a car. But actually, there's no ghost here, but GM's Super Cruise technology. Chances are it will become a marketable product within the next 5 years. Although GM has not confirmed a firm launch date, it also hopes Super Cruise will be available soon by the end of the decade, 2017 or 2018 at the earliest. Super Cruise is part of a trend that has rekindled in the past few years. Safe driving systems have appeared in many modern car products such as collision warning systems, parking assist, adaptive cruise control, blind-spot control system, and other features. This trend is inching users towards buying automatic cars. Using a combination of sensors, radar, GPS, and cameras, the system allows the vehicle to identify nearby objects and warn of problems, even stopping the vehicle if a collision is imminent with another vehicle or pedestrian on the road. Technologically, GM's Super Cruise resembles the driver assistance system of Mercedes-Benz and other automakers. However, such systems also require the driver to touch the steering wheel frequently to ensure the driver remains in control. Functionally, this is revolutionary. The car can be completely self-driving on highways. Super Cruise represents an important shift in the driver-vehicle relationship in the history of automotive technology. At the current level, the driver still needs to pay attention and be ready to take control of the vehicle when encountering situations beyond the system's ability to handle. Therefore, the self-driving and driving assistance system will need to combine with the driver monitoring system to ensure safety. How far has Vietnam's self-driving car technology developed? VinAi's driver monitoring system can detect drowsy drivers while wearing sunglasses. The solution developed by Vietnam is based on facial recognition technology ranked in the top 6 in the world. In addition to being able to accurately recognize the driver's condition, it also has the advantage of being able to work even when the driver wears glasses. shady. Besides, the domestically developed solution is also compatible with many different hardware platforms, so vehicle manufacturers can integrate the solution onto existing hardware. By 2023, a driver monitoring system will be mandatory on all cars that want to achieve the 5-star Euro NCAP safety certification. VinAI has not announced the exact time to put these technologies into commercialization, or which partners it has shaken hands with. But VinFast's upcoming electric car models will likely be integrated with these technologies. It is expected that VinFast's first electric car delivery will start from November this year.</p><br/>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">What is the likely impact?</div>
				<p>Not only will it change the entire face of the auto industry, but the growth and popularity of self-driving cars over the next 100 years could also have a huge impact on every sector globally, including healthcare, education, urban infrastructure architecture. Simultaneously changing human life and culture. In addition to reducing the number of people killed in accidents due to safer driving, self-driving cars could also reduce cancer rates by reducing anxiety and stress. Comfort and happiness are closely related to time and the stressful nature of traveling on the road. It may seem unrelated, but the development of self-driving cars will put medicine in a difficult situation. The traffic accident caused grief for the victim's family but brought hope to many others through organ donation. Self-driving cars help reduce traffic accidents but will put medicine in shortage of organs, and the industry will see a strong development of 3D printing of organs in the next few decades. Without having to transport children, not directly driving, people can save an average of 15 days and nights per year. According to the United Nations and the World Health Organization (WHO), the earth now has more than 3.5 billion urban residents, accounting for 54% of the global population. Thanks to self-driving cars, people will no longer be afraid of driving and accept being further away from the workplace. On the contrary, the architecture industry must also adapt to this new development. Not only urban infrastructure architecture but also housing architecture. Accordingly, architectural firms will have to be creative in the direction of seeing the car as a friendly part of the house instead of being left in a separate garage. The development of self-driving cars is happening in tandem with the development of clean energy. Self-driving cars will eliminate the driver, but reap many energy benefits, especially the technology of electric self-driving cars combined with grid electricity. Morgan Stanley predicts that self-driving cars could save the United States up to $1.3 trillion a year by reducing fuel consumption.</p><br/>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">How will this affect you?</div>
				<p>Self-driving cars will save me money on gas. It will help my family get more chat time in the car because then three or I don't have to be 100% focused on driving anymore. In addition, if the whole world uses self-driving cars, I believe my life will become safer because I believe that programming the system will help navigate the cars more intelligently. In addition, self-driving cars will make my life more convenient, as I can text, call or read books while sitting in the car. In other words it saves me more time. Throughout a lifetime, people will have an extra 4.3 years of free time and can use this time for more useful things instead of being stuck behind the wheel. Self-driving cars will have features like “Kid mode” to travel short distances with a controlled route within a certain limit. This generation will grow up with increasing routes and distances. Self-driving cars will help this population become more independent and explore more on their own. In addition, using self-driving cars powered by solar, wind or electricity will help the living environment around me and my family and friends become cleaner and fresher. In addition, self-driving cars will make it easier for my grandparents (who are physically weak) to move from their house to mine. Furthermore, I believe autonomous cars will cost less than cars today. In short, automatic cars make my life more convenient and save time. It helps my family reduce vehicle costs, making commuting easier.</p><br/>
