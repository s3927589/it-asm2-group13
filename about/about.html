		<p class="about-content">
			I am the first member of the team. My full name is Nguyen Minh Anh. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. My student number and email are S3927589 and s3927589@rmit.edu.vn, respectively. Before attending RMIT, I spent three years studying Computer Science at Thompson Rivers University in Canada. Because of the covid pandemic, I decided to move back to Vietnam and continue my study at RMIT. My specialization is developing Artificial Intelligence models and researching new techniques. In my spare time, I usually play basketball and practice doing magic tricks. When playing basketball, I normally hold the Point Guard position, so I am really into dribbling. As for magic tricks, I am a magic creator as well as performer and normally work with coins and playing cards.

			As the second member of the team, my name is Pham Thi Thuy Duong who has a background in Digital Marketing. My student identification number and email address are s3836551 and s3836551@rmit.edu.vn , respectively. Probably the best way to characterize me is as well organized, energetic, and open. I first became aware of K-Pop during my senior year of high school; since then, I've had a strong conviction in K-Pop stars, which has had a huge good effect on my personality and interests. They are a huge source of inspiration for me in the fields of Media, Photoshop, and Technology, which are all areas of my passion that I am constantly researching and learning about. Besides, I enjoy skateboarding and watching movies, particularly K-Dramas, in my spare time. Korean dramas have done an amazing job of providing a fulfilling experience of filmmaking, from camera angle to content to soundtrack, enticing me to do something to improve the Vietnamese film industry in the near future.

		<p class="about-content">
			As the fourth member of the group, my name is Khang Minh Nguyen. My RMIT ID: s3931505. My email address: s3931505@rmit.edu.vn. I am an emotional person. Although I am interested in math, chess and things related to reasoning, I suppose that most of my decisions are more emotional. I was born in Long An province, and my childhood revolved around Japanese anime such as Conan, Doraemon. The adventures in the stories made me extremely amazed and curious about the world around me so I love to travel and learn about the culture of the places I visit. Because of that enthusiasm for discovery, I decided to study abroad in the US at a high school in California. There, I met friends from many different countries. They are very friendly and nice to me. I am most impressed by the people from Korea because they are very smart and handsome. One of them visited Vietnam and I became his guide. After graduating from high school, I applied to a university in the city of Seattle in Washington state to major in computer science. However, the Covid 19 epidemic suddenly came and disrupted my life and made me decide to return to Vietnam and study at RMIT University in Information Technology. I believe that God has a special mission for each of us and that God is always with me on my way.

	<p class="about-content">
		I am the third member. My name is Nguyen Huu Thanh Binh. My students ID and email are s3836542 and S3836542@rmit.edu.vn. My major is Digital Marketing, and my general elective is Introduction to Information Systems. I have learned in the fifth semester at RMIT. I chose this course because I want to expand my understanding of IT in the context of the Industry 4.0 transformation. As a result, I can adjust to market trends and grow my business in the future. Watching anime and reading comic books, particularly manga, are two of my favorite pastimes. Football is my favorite sport, and it is also the activity in which I excel. I used to play football for the local club when I was 12 years old, but my family disagreed with me spending so much time doing so. Therefore, I just play football for fun now.
