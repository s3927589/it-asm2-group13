			I am the first member of the team. My full name is Nguyen Minh Anh. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. My student number and email are S3927589 and s3927589@rmit.edu.vn, respectively. Before attending RMIT, I spent three years studying Computer Science at Thompson Rivers University in Canada. Because of the covid pandemic, I decided to move back to Vietnam and continue my study at RMIT. My specialization is developing Artificial Intelligence models and researching new techniques. In my spare time, I usually play basketball and practice doing magic tricks. When playing basketball, I normally hold the Point Guard position, so I am really into dribbling. As for magic tricks, I am a magic creator as well as performer and normally work with coins and playing cards.

		I am the third member. My name is Nguyen Huu Thanh Binh. My students ID and email are s3836542 and S3836542@rmit.edu.vn. My major is Digital Marketing, and my general elective is Introduction to Information Systems. I have learned in the fifth semester at RMIT. I chose this course because I want to expand my understanding of IT in the context of the Industry 4.0 transformation. As a result, I can adjust to market trends and grow my business in the future. Watching anime and reading comic books, particularly manga, are two of my favorite pastimes. Football is my favorite sport, and it is also the activity in which I excel. I used to play football for the local club when I was 12 years old, but my family disagreed with me spending so much time doing so. Therefore, I just play football for fun now.
