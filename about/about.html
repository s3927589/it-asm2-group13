		<p class="about-content">
			I am the first member of the team. My full name is Nguyen Minh Anh. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. My student number and email are S3927589 and s3927589@rmit.edu.vn, respectively. Before attending RMIT, I spent three years studying Computer Science at Thompson Rivers University in Canada. Because of the covid pandemic, I decided to move back to Vietnam and continue my study at RMIT. My specialization is developing Artificial Intelligence models and researching new techniques. In my spare time, I usually play basketball and practice doing magic tricks. When playing basketball, I normally hold the Point Guard position, so I am really into dribbling. As for magic tricks, I am a magic creator as well as performer and normally work with coins and playing cards.

		<p class="about-content">
			As the fourth member of the group, my name is Khang Minh Nguyen. My RMIT ID: s3931505. My email address: s3931505@rmit.edu.vn. I am an emotional person. Although I am interested in math, chess and things related to reasoning, I suppose that most of my decisions are more emotional. I was born in Long An province, and my childhood revolved around Japanese anime such as Conan, Doraemon. The adventures in the stories made me extremely amazed and curious about the world around me so I love to travel and learn about the culture of the places I visit. Because of that enthusiasm for discovery, I decided to study abroad in the US at a high school in California. There, I met friends from many different countries. They are very friendly and nice to me. I am most impressed by the people from Korea because they are very smart and handsome. One of them visited Vietnam and I became his guide. After graduating from high school, I applied to a university in the city of Seattle in Washington state to major in computer science. However, the Covid 19 epidemic suddenly came and disrupted my life and made me decide to return to Vietnam and study at RMIT University in Information Technology. I believe that God has a special mission for each of us and that God is always with me on my way.
