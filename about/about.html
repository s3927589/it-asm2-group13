		<p class="about-content">
			I am the first member of the team. My full name is Nguyen Minh Anh. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. My student number and email are S3927589 and s3927589@rmit.edu.vn, respectively. Before attending RMIT, I spent three years studying Computer Science at Thompson Rivers University in Canada. Because of the covid pandemic, I decided to move back to Vietnam and continue my study at RMIT. My specialization is developing Artificial Intelligence models and researching new techniques. In my spare time, I usually play basketball and practice doing magic tricks. When playing basketball, I normally hold the Point Guard position, so I am really into dribbling. As for magic tricks, I am a magic creator as well as performer and normally work with coins and playing cards.

		<p class="about-content">
			As the second member of the team, my name is Pham Thi Thuy Duong who has a background in Digital Marketing. My student identification number and email address are s3836551 and s3836551@rmit.edu.vn , respectively. Probably the best way to characterize me is as well organized, energetic, and open. I first became aware of K-Pop during my senior year of high school; since then, I've had a strong conviction in K-Pop stars, which has had a huge good effect on my personality and interests. They are a huge source of inspiration for me in the fields of Media, Photoshop, and Technology, which are all areas of my passion that I am constantly researching and learning about. Besides, I enjoy skateboarding and watching movies, particularly K-Dramas, in my spare time. Korean dramas have done an amazing job of providing a fulfilling experience of filmmaking, from camera angle to content to soundtrack, enticing me to do something to improve the Vietnamese film industry in the near future.
