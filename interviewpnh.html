			<div class="blog-title">An interview with Mr. Pham Ngoc Hoang</div>

			<div class="blog-content">
				<img class="blog-img" src="./images/interview.webp" alt="blog img" /><br/><br/>

				<p>My team has an interview with Pham Ngoc Hoang, who works in the TMA solutions company. This company has more than 2000 thousand employees and has almost all jobs related to the IT industry, such as Coder, Tester, and more. Hoang’s job is a tester and he has more than 3 years working experience in this company. We are so thankful  from the bottom of our heart for taking time from his busy schedule to be the guest speaker for the assessment. His presence and wise words helped magnify our work in the best possible way.</p>

				<p>Hoang is a manual tester, and his job is to look over the project from clients to find out what's wrong and report it to another department to fix it together. In the first process, he reviewed the project's features to grasp goals and functions, and then he devised a strategy to test the new feature, functions, software, and system. He will write the test key after completing the plan, including all potential elements and current faults. The test key aims to allow everyone on the team to notice the problem and run the test when he is busy to open it for the team. Moreover, he also built the same customer system to conduct his test, allowing him to confirm that any errors are resolved before delivering to clients. Moreover, when his team discovers the bug, they will upload the file to the company's server, where all members can track it. Therefore, they can work with other departments to remedy these problems, and the manager will then assess whether to deliver this product to the customer or not.
                    </p><br/>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</div>
				<p>Currently, his team consists of more than 30 people, with five of them having more than ten years of experience in the organization. He spends the majority of his time with his manager and five key members of his team. When he has a difficulty that he can't handle, he frequently seeks advice or assistance from essential members. On the other hand, most of his customers are from the US such as Amanda company, the major communication ways between them are mail and online meetings. The purpose of this appointment is to decide the deadline of this project and set the goal. As he mentioned, he prefers online meetings to mail because he can easily explain things to consumers and receive feedback quickly.

                </p><br/>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">Where do the IT professionals spend most of their time?</div>
				<p>Because of the nature of his occupations, he spends the majority of his time at the office and home. It provides a soothing area, snack, and drink at his office, making him feel at ease and motivating him to work in the company. When the company has difficulty or has an emergency job, he may have to stay at the office overnight to fix the situation with his team.</p><br/>

                <div class="blog-subtitle">The most challenging aspect of his career</div>
				<p>In his opinion, the most challenging part of him is working with the customer. To explain, most of his customers are foreigners, and his English is insufficient to convey all of his ideas to them. Sometimes, the customer is from India and has a difficult to understand accent, so he cannot understand all of the information provided. Thankfully, he has a good manager and team members who will explain this information to him after the appointment. Furthermore, Time differences are also a challenge for him, as he must have very late online meetings with his customers to collaborate or deliver his results to them. Therefore, it causes him to be tired the next morning and to have less energy to do his work.</p><br/>
