			Cybersecurity (information security) refers to the act of protecting a computer system against the attacks of hackers (“Cybersecurity”, n.d). The vital, sensitive, and secure data are protected from malicious parties by the cybersecurity policy. There are many forms of cyberattacks such as phishing, sniffing, and ransomware. Data privacy is a type of cybersecurity that handles the issues regarding data consent, sensitivity, and notice (“Cybersecurity”, n.d). In other words, data privacy refers to the understanding of customers about their rights and how their data will be collected, stored, used, and shared. Any data usage must be explained apparently to the customers and the owner's consent must be acquired before the data are collected and used.<br/></br>

			Cybersecurity attacks are normally aimed at stealing personal data or even the company’s data. The risk of leaking data at companies of any size is increasing every day. Thus, protecting data from breaching is a priority that every organization needs to make. Businesses should concentrate on data security training, and create a security policy to protect their systems. Several feasible solutions for preventing organizations’ data from being stolen will be discussed below.<br/></br>

			The first way to protect data is by limiting the access of data and only keeping the latest version of it. Most of the data breaches are caused by employees’ errors (“Cybersecurity”, n.d). Thus, it is necessary to divide appropriate rights and permissions for each staff to keep the data safer. Once a piece of data is processed or no longer used in the future, the employees are required to destroy it completely including the versions on their laptop, on the company system, and all of its backups. Some certain policies should be created by the company to properly delete or archive old data.<br/></br>

			Furthermore, setting up a password protection program is also an effective way to protect the system from cyberattacks (“Cybersecurity”, n.d). Businesses and the staff must set a strong password for all the sites that they access. A password should follow a certain rue such as including both uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. One of the most useful ways to generate a strong password is creating a random sentence and taking all of the initial characters including the punctuation of that sentence to be the password. Another crucial thing is passwords must not be shared between employees or written down. The best way to secure a password is by memorizing it and keeping it a secret.<br/></br>

			Updating the company’s software regularly will also help keep the data secured. Organizations should use antivirus software and firewalls to enhance the security level of their systems (“Cybersecurity”, n.d). These types of software usually require regular updates to give the best protection and fix any malfunctioning components from previous versions. It is vital to check the vendor’s website on a daily basis to know more about any new patches or updates.<br/></br>

			The final crucial solution is employee training. People are one of the most important factors to keep sensitive data from being accessed by hackers. Companies should train their employees about all the methods to protect the data. They must safeguard both the digital and physical components of the system to keep the system at the highest security level (“Cybersecurity”, n.d).<br/></br>

			What is the likely impact?
		</div>
		<p class="research-section-content">
			Cybersecurity and privacy play a more and more vital role in business and society. People are increasingly dependent on technology and the trend has no sign of going down. Sensitive data such as social insurance numbers and credit card information are vulnerable to identity theft since they are usually stored in a cloud-based platform like Google Drive (Tunggal, 2021). Once the sensitive data are leaked or stolen, enormous consequences will occur. Hackers can use others’ identity information to commit a crime. In the business scope, data leaking can lead to a vast loss in profit and affect the company’s reputation. If the organization’s plan is disclosed to its competitor, the competitor can come up with a strategy to beat up the company. Also, if users’ data are leaked or stolen, users’ trust in the company will reduce, which causes a decline in the number of both current and potential customers. Therefore, companies and the government should pay more attention to cybercrime and enhance the system’s security.<br/><br/>

			How will this affect you?

			Since security is crucial for all systems, I need to take the issue seriously to protect my data. When I was a child, I got hacked and lost many important documents. It made me very upset since all my work was gone and I had to start recreating all of them from the beginning. Thus, using trustworthy and strong antivirus software is necessary. I paid around 1 million VND for Kaspersky to keep my computer secured. Since I studied Information Technology, I understood more about the importance of cybersecurity. I have learned many security principles and techniques to build a strong and secure system. When building software, I always make a high priority for security. Moreover, I also help everyone around me including my family and friends to protect their data and do not let them get into a situation like I was.<br/><br/>
