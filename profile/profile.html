				Generally, the test is fair enough to test basic character types. The question set seems reasonable but there are many repeated questions with the same meaning. The final result is not quite accurate but some of the listed factors such as conscientiousness and neuroticism are correct.

			<div class="profile-title">Learning Style Test</div>

			<p class="profile-content">
				Although the test is a little bit short (about 15 questions), the result is correct. However, this kind of type is more likely to get the correct result since the questions are very straight forward and trivial. For example, it asked me whether I would like to visualize or hear things to memorize better. I answered that I preferred visualizing, so it yielded the result that I was a “visual” person. Thus, the test is good for the leader to understand his members, but not really useful for anyone to explore himself or herself.

			<div class="profile-title">The Big Five Test</div>

			<p class="profile-content">
				The first part of this Big Five test has a really similar question set as the Myers-Briggs test. The second part is different but there are still many repeated questions. However, the result is accurate in terms of the neutral reaction section.
