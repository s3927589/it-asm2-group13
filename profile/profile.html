				One may argue that the test accurately reflects my personality (introvert) and mental wellness. Regardless of whether I enjoy crowds or am comfortable attending large gatherings, I still struggle to acclimate to speaking and mingling with strangers in real life.

				Generally, the test is fair enough to test basic character types. The question set seems reasonable but there are many repeated questions with the same meaning. The final result is not quite accurate but some of the listed factors such as conscientiousness and neuroticism are correct.

				Although the test is a little bit short (about 15 questions), the result is correct. However, this kind of type is more likely to get the correct result since the questions are very straight forward and trivial. For example, it asked me whether I would like to visualize or hear things to memorize better. I answered that I preferred visualizing, so it yielded the result that I was a “visual” person. Thus, the test is good for the leader to understand his members, but not really useful for anyone to explore himself or herself.

				The first part of this Big Five test has a really similar question set as the Myers-Briggs test. The second part is different but there are still many repeated questions. However, the result is accurate in terms of the neutral reaction section.

				When I finished the Myers-Briggs test, the website suggested characters with similar personalities to me as a Debater such as The Joker, Captain Jack Sparrow, Thomas Edison. They are characters with very unique and cool living ideals. Incidentally, they are all characters from history and movies that I love and admire very much. I agree with what the analysis says about me. In addition to the basic personality, I always want to show my reasoning ability to defend an idea that I consider to be true. Thanks to these tests, I know myself better. It helps me express things inside of me that I didn't know what to call, even though I was aware of them. exist inside of me.

				I am a person who loves challenges and asking questions. Therefore, when working in groups, I will not hesitate to ask questions to stimulate the imagination and creativity of everyone in the group. I'm an open-minded person, and I believe that makes it easier and comfortable for everyone to work with each other. In addition, through these tests, I now realize that my arguments now tend to be that I want to be the winner. The test analyzes that I should not be like that, but consider arguing is a way to understand people better and build consensus and relationships.

				Once I've secured such a position, in my mind, I always know that I need to remember for my ideas to come to fruition, I will always depend on others to assemble the pieces. First I will find like-minded people to form a team. It would be great if I could work with people with similar personalities, but the differences can also be pieces of the puzzle that make the picture more complete. I think in my team I need someone with a calm head to cool me down when needed. Examples are the times when I am excited, over-excited or overly ambitious, delusional about something. Since very argumentative and Dislike Practical Matters are my weaknesses.
