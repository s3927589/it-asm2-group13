				<div class="blog-subtitle">What does it do?</div>
				<p>Though it may not look like humans or perform duties in a humanlike manner, a robot is an automatically operated equipment that replaces human effort (Moravec nd). There are several kinds of robots with different functions such as Androids are human-like robots that are mobile, moving around on wheels or a track drive. For a telepresence system, a Telechir is a complicated robot that is operated remotely by a human operator. The industrial robot is a reprogrammable multipurpose manipulator and autonomously operated. Furthermore, combining these robots with artificial intelligence has aided organizations in moving beyond simple automation to higher-level and more sophisticated jobs (Techtarget 2021). These robots will assist people in increasing productivity and avoiding mishaps in some hazardous tasks.</p>
				<p>According to Bentley (2020), robots already perform a variety of duties in several sectors, and scientists are aiming to increase automation even further, with robots taking over more and more production processes. Because of the advancements in robot function, they are now found in a wider range of organizations. More than two hundred thousand mobile robots operate alongside human workers in Amazon's warehouse. This robotic army has aided the corporation in delivering on its ever-increasing promises of fast deliveries to Amazon Prime members (Rey 2019). Robots are useful not only in warehouse operations but also in the service business, such as restaurants. In Japan, some restaurants utilize waiter robots to serve guests, which helps them operate their businesses more effectively and save money on personnel recruiting (Suzuki and Nagumo 2018). </p>
				<p>Based on my research, medical robots will be employed increasingly in the future to assist with patient care chores while ensuring the safety of healthcare employees. Thousands of doctors and nurses have become ill as a result of the Covid-19 outbreaks, and hundreds have died. It becomes more dangerous when the amount of personal protective equipment available is insufficient, forcing them to re-use this product (Hauser and Sham 2020). If the robot were used in this circumstance, the number of doctors and nurses who died would be reduced. Furthermore, because robots can help decrease the present high cost of senior care, utilizing robots to take care elderly will become popular. Robots can assist the elderly with basic tasks such as getting food and drink, mobility, and transportation support (Automate 2020). In addition, scientists seek to integrate AI communication into robots so that the elderly may easily communicate with them and robots can learn new duties to assist their employers.</p>
				<p>The replication of human intellectual processes by machines, particularly computer systems, is known as artificial intelligence (AI) (Copeland 2021). By using this technology, it will contribute to the development of an AI function that will aid doctors in their medical work. For example, doctors may teach robots fundamental surgery abilities, which will aid them in receiving an effective cut due to the robot's high exact ratio. Another factor driving the growth of the robot medical industry is the scarcity of labor in the healthcare industry (Lytle 2020). Because of the covid-19, there are a large number of patients, and there are some limitations in taking care of them. Based on AI technology and the challenge of the healthcare industry, it will aid the development of medical robots in the future.

				<div class="blog-subtitle">What is the likely impact?</div>
				<p>According to Racoma (2019), robotics development has a significant impact on businesses, assisting them in increasing productivity and streamlining processes. For example, in large warehouses, robots are also utilized to inspect and move products securely and effectively. In dangerous jobs or situations, robots can take the place of people. Stunts for movies or acting as decoys in military operations are examples of duties that robots can perform. However, robots have a tremendous influence on employees by displacing people from their occupations. The researchers discovered that for every 1,000 robots added to the workforce in the United States, salaries fall by 0.42 percent and the employment-to-population ratio falls by 0.2 percentage points, resulting in the loss of nearly 400,000 jobs to date (Brown 2020). To explain, Businesses seek to deploy robots to lower the cost of hiring workers because contemporary robots can finish duties quickly and make tasks easier to perform.</p><br/>

				<div class="blog-subtitle">How will this affect you?</div>
				<p>Obviously, robots are not popular in Vietnam nowadays so it has a small impact on my daily life. However, robots are being used to serve covid-19 patients in makeshift hospitals in big cities like Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi, which will help them deal with the shortage of human resources. Moreover, cleaning robots, which are self-contained robotic vacuum cleaners with a restricted vacuum floor cleaning system, sensors, robotic drives, programmable controllers, and cleaning routines, are becoming increasingly popular in Vietnam. I already have one robot in my home, which is quite handy for me because it allows me to focus less on housework. On the other hand, In the future, robots will have an impact on my family's business. My family plans to purchase some transport robots to assist us in transporting things to cut the expense of hiring workers and increase productivity.</p><br/>
